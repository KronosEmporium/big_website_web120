<h2>Shopping Carts</h2>

<p>&emsp;Shopping carts provide a merchant functionality for websites. They allow companies and individuals to sell products, services, and other wares online. Many popular websites like Amazon, Ebay, and Mercari implement shopping carts that persist with a user’s account, and allow users to pay for products via a 3rd party payment processor.1 Ready-made implementations of shopping carts exist to allow web developers to easily create an online store for a client. Many of these easy-to-use solutions also exist for popular DIY or website builder services like Wordpress and Wix.2 Wix also comes with a shopping cart feature which precludes the need to shop around for plugins on another site that may be more difficult to implement. One of the most popular and most used is Shopify, renowned for its ease-of-use and reasonable price. Shopify also boasts a quickened time to launch and good scalability for growing businesses. Another popular shopping cart is BigCommerce, rated 9.8 out of 10 on FinancesOnline.com.3 By implementing shopping cart software on a site, online businesses can simplify generating business and revenue. Small business owners with a shippable product can control the look, feel, and cost of their store and products with a customizable solution, rather than using a pre-existing solution like Amazon or another e-retailer that may take a significant portion of the sale price of a product. In the long run, implementing a licensed or self-owned solution generates more profit and better product awareness.</p>
