<h2>Responsive vs. Mobile</h2>

<p>&emsp;Responsive web design and mobile app web design are two separate paradigms in modern website development, both with pros and cons to their implementation. In general, “each offers its own benefits, and one isn’t necessarily better than the other,” but it depends “on your business needs.”1</p>

<p>&emsp;Responsive designs are usually mobile-focused website designs that target smaller screens, ensuring content is specifically tailored to phone or tablet displays. This simplifies designing the site as there is a general size range for mobile devices that helps developers know what kind of content they can display and how to arrange the site. Responsive designs have generally proven to be more cost-effective than the alternative, mobile apps, simply because you are only making a website for one platform (with a modest amount of cross-browser standardization / testing) that will be accessible from a wide range of devices, not only mobile. For some businesses it is preferable to have some site available, and a mobile app may be overkill.</p>

<p>&emsp;Mobile apps, on the other hand, are OS-specific applications developed with a deluxe specificity for users. The intensive and multi-targeted development of a mobile app results in higher costs, so research and preliminary development sketches are necessary. Mobile apps overall have more features than responsive sites because they are stored on a device, allowing them to be used offline. Some sites necessitate using a mobile app in order to have full functionality of a platform, such as Twitter or Instagram. The industry for mobile apps is doing well, and growing steadily, with results like “in 2018 the mobile app industry [generating] 92.1 billion [dollars] in global app revenue.”2</p>

<p>&emsp;As mobile apps grow in popularity, websites may be less impressive for a company to rely on. However, having multiple platform offerings will always be necessary or desirable.</p>
