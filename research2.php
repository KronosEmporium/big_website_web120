<h2>Galleries</h2>

<p>&emsp;Galleries are methods for displaying images on a website. They vary in style and presentation, and many resources exist to quickly and easily implement pre-written variations. Another term that refers to image galleries is “slider”, which is a particular type of gallery that usually presents all images in the gallery in some assortment and slides or transitions between them. This differs from other types of galleries that might only display a single image when clicked or accessed, or an automatic gallery that displays images based on preset rules, or another type of collective image display. Some of the most popular galleries are sliders, such as AviaSlider, S3Slider, and Slide JS. Some of these premade solutions have premium versions while others are free, but paid versions offer a lot of easy customization so you can alter the look and feel of the sliding image gallery. Free gallery solutions also exist, with such sites as Cincopa offering simple templates for various types of galleries. Implementing your own gallery is not prohibitively hard, but with a bounty of ready-made options it really isn’t necessary to reinvent the wheel.</p>

<p>&emsp;If, however, creating a gallery is something you want to look into, there is, again, hundreds if not thousands of resources to assist you. Even w3schools.com has a CSS Image Gallery tutorial page. The amount of existing sliders and galleries shows how many options one has in creating another HTML gallery. You could create a gallery that, like many others, adds a blur or dim to the content surrounding the currently displayed image. A gallery could have a transition effect where the currently selected image appears to flip in a 3d animation to reveal the next image in the gallery. Or, in a more classic style, the image could slide off-screen or into a gradual invisibility as the next one takes its place. The best option is really a matter of preference and taste. Tweaking an existing gallery is also possible, though it’s important not to misrepresent any resources used or to misuse copied content in any way.</p>
